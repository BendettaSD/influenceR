Description: This package provides functionality to compute various node centrality measures on networks.
    Included here are functions to compute betweenness centrality (by utilizing Madduri and Bader's
    SNAP library), implementations of Burt's constraint and effective
    network size (ENS) metrics, Borgatti's algorithm to identify key players, and Valente's
    bridging metric. On Unix systems, the betweenness, Key Players, and
    bridging implementations are parallelized with OpenMP on, which may run
    faster on systems which have OpenMP configured.
